Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty case. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

What is this ?
This project has the simple goal of writing a Gomoku AI Engine, capable of playing by itself. It can even defeat you if in just few turns !!! The AI need to understand the Gomocup [protocol]: http://petr.lastovicka.sweb.cz/protocl2en.htm to work with Piskvork.


This AI is made for the Piskvork application downloadable here : https://sourceforge.net/projects/piskvork/
